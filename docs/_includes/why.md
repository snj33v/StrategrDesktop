Strategr __is not a calendar__, but a time-boxing tool â€” by design, there is no dates, no date-bounded "events" per se.

It's aim is to make daily planning quick and flexible by using a bit different paradigm that conventional calendar apps use. 

Most calendar apps are great for scheduling something like meetings and appointments, but using them for comprehensive daily planning can quickly become tedious - this is where Strategr shines. 

Try it out youself, and see if it helps your workflow!
