Currenly, Strategr is available for macOS and Windows only, and there is an iOS version under development. 

It is written mostly in cross-platform C++, and, although it is ready to be ported to other platforms, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done to ensure that its behavior is consistent and UI is top quality, so any of your help is appreciated!

__Strategr is free and will stay free__.
