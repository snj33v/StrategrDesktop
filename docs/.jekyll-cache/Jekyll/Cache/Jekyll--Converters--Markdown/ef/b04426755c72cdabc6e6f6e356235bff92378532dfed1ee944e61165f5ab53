<p>Currenly, Strategr is available for macOS and Windows only, and there is an iOS version under development. 
It is written mostly in cross-platform C++, and, although it is ready to be ported to various platforms, thereâ€™s still a lot of work that needs to be done to ensure that its behavior is consistent and UI is top quality.</p>

<p><strong>Strategr is free and will stay free</strong>, so any of your help is appreciated!</p>
